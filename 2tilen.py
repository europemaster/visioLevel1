##### INSTRUCTIONS #####
# Create a program which:
# - calculates average price
# - calculates max and min price
# - counts how many items could be food, clothes or tech and how many items are above price of any of these
# - can I buy all the items with moneyAvailable (prints True or False)
# use loops, if/else, arrays...
