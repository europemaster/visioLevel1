# 2 create a function that simulates purchases
# let's say there are 100 purchases in a lifetime of a program where a timeout
# between the two is 3 seconds. `sleep(3)`
# use helper4.random_winner() function to get winning number
# if the winning number equals the number of the customer, purchase is free,
# use function from exercise #1, wait for 10 seconds, and move on to the next customer
# function returns the number of money earned, if the customer does not have enough money
# print "customer without money" and move on. this customer's purchase is not added
# to the money earned
